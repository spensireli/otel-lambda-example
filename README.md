This repository showcases how to use OpenTelemetry with AWS Lambda and X-Ray for enhanced observability.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.

## What is X-Ray?

[AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) provides a complete view of requests as they travel through your application and filters visual data across payloads, functions, traces, services, APIs, and more with no-code and low-code motions.
