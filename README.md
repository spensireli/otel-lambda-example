# OTEL with AWS Lambda and AWSEMF Exporter

This repository showcases how to use OpenTelemetry with AWS Lambda and X-Ray for enhanced observability.

For information on what each component is doing see the [Project Breakdown](#Project Breakdown) section.

## Deploying This Project

This project requires AWS CDK `2.85.0` or higher. 

```bash scripts/build.sh```

```cdk deploy```

## Deployed Endpoints

### /hello
This endpoint operates normally and will respond with a 200 along with trace information.

### /sleepy
This endpoint simulates long running processes and takes 10 seconds to complete. You can 
see in the trace the time it has taken to run the particular function.

### /broken
This endpoint intentionally does not work. The call will fail and you can see the trace and exactly which 
function failed using OTEL + X-Ray. 

## What is OpenTelemetry?

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.

Some benefits to using OTEL over proprietary distributing tracing technology are:

- Standardization of how telemetry data is collected and reported on.
- Prevents vendor lock-in. 
- Provides out of the box support with a number of third-party [vendors](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/).
- OpenSource & Free

# Project Breakdown

## Lessons Learned

- Documentation explaining the integration of OTEl and X-Ray is lacking. Lots of articles but little explains the how and why.
- OTEL Version changes can impact operatbility with X-Ray.
- How OTEL is used in a production setting.
- How to send OTEL Metrics to CloudWatch Metrics using AWS EMF Exporter.
- There exists an OTEL Lambda Layer maintained by AWS
